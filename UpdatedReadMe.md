<b><i>Analysis on Kickstarter Outcomes</b></i>

<b>Overview</b>

After crowdfunding for her upcoming play, Fever, Louise nearly reached her goal of $10,000.  She utilized data analysis by researching other outcomes to determine what factors would lead to successful campaigns and how likely she would be to reach her goal.  The purpose of this project was to compare other crowdfunding campaigns in a similar category of theater and see how successful they were based on launch dates and funding goals.

<b>Analysis and Challenges</b>

<i>Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date</i> 

For this particular category, the most successful outcomes in theater occurred in May with a total of 111.  This is also when the most failures occurred with a total of 52. January saw the most canceled theater campaigns, which was seven.

<i>Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals</i> 

The greatest number of successful outcomes can be found in campaign goals of $1000-4999. This also contains the most failed outcomes, which at a total number of 534 projects makes this the most popular category for theater campaigns. while goals of $1000 or less only contain 141 successful outcomes, they have the highest percentage of success at 76% compared to a 24% rate of failure.

<b>Challenges and Difficulties Encountered </b>

<i>What possible challenges could have been encountered?</i> 

Possible challenges could have included creating an inaccurate PivotTable to display the data for Outcomes Based on Launch Dates.  If one descriptive item had been left out, the data would be skewed and an incorrect analysis provided.  This could affect the client’s decision and change her campaign outcome.

<b>Results</b>

<i>Outcomes Based on Launch Date</i>

Based on the data provided, we can conclude that the best time of year to launch a successful campaign is in May due to the greater number of successes in other theater campaigns.  The successful outcomes decline through the summer and fall months and begin to rise again in spring.  However, the most failed campaigns are also in May, though they are less than half as likely as successful campaigns.

<i>Outcomes Based on Goals</i>

In the category of Outcomes Based on Goals, it is evident that the higher the goal, the less likely it reaches success.  Goals with $20,000 or more record less than 50% success, and more than 50% failures.  The lower the goal, the more successful it is.  Goals under $5000 record more than 70% success.

<i>Limitations of this dataset</i>

Other factors beyond launch dates and monetary goals aren’t included.  It is hard to determine exactly what will lead the client to success without considering all of the factors involved.  It would also be helpful to gather a dataset that shows the length of time for each campaign.  Were longer campaigns more successful than shorter ones?  The answer cannot be provided based on the data in this dataset.

<b>Recommendations</b>  

One useful graph could show what countries had the most successful campaigns in theater.  This would give the client an idea on a location to launch her campaign.
